# 6.10 Impacts of CS

1. Which citizen science app did you explore? What is the purpose of the app? Describe the functionality of the app.

2. What data does the app use and how does the app use the data collected? For example, as a citizen scientist using the BloomWatch app, you would take pictures of cyanobacteria blooms in water and submit the image along with the date, the state and town, weather conditions, surface water conditions, bloom size, public access to the water, and any comments youâ€™d like to add. BloomWatch specifies they will store it in a public database for analysis in helping to understand the occurrence and locations of cyanobacteria blooms, but they might also send the data to state water quality agencies. (Hint: you might need to install the app or look at screenshots of the app to find out the data it collects.)

3. What are the intended positive impacts of your citizen science app? What might be some unintended negative impacts? You might consider impacts on society, the economy, culture, etc.
