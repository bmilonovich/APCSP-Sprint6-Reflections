# AP CSP Sprint 5 Reflections

## Algorithms & Procedural Abstraction

You will find MD (Markdown) files within this repo (repository) for you to type reflection responses in. All files you are submitting for points must be uploaded to within this repo, or linked where appropriate. Have questions as we go through this Sprint on how you should be handling the work flow? ***ASK ME.***  

>*I will be grading based exclusively from what I can easily find in this repo. SO, if something is missing or you didn't follow instructions, I won't go searching all over for it. Paying attention to detail is important in computer science!*

The following links take you to other pages that have been created within this repo. That is where the reflection questions for each lesson are, and you should answer them directly within that page.

>You also need to upload relevant files (such as .apk and .aia files for coding you have done, screenshots, or links to group POGIL documents).
