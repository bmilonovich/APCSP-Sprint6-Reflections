# 6.06 Cryptography Basics

1. Complete the following table, describe the encryption and decryption process for each cipher, and how each can be broken.

| Cipher              | Encryption process | Decryption process | How it can be broken |
|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Caesar              |                    |                    |                      |
| Simple substitution |                    |                    |                      |
| Vigenere            |                    |                    |                      |

2. Explain why the benefits of symmetric ciphers are negated by the issue of key exchange.
