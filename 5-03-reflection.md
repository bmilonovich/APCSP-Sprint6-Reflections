# 5.3 Search Algorithms

1. (POGIL) Define a pseudocode algorithm that will efficiently play the guessing game.

2. (POGIL) To guess a number between 1 and 100, what's the maximum number of guesses your algorithm would take?

3. (POGIL) To guess a number between 1 and 500, what's the maximum number of guesses your algorithm would take?

4. Suppose you have a deck of cards and you want to find the Ace of Spades. If the deck is shuffled, which is the best search algorithm to use and why?

5. Give an example of a search problem you encounter in everyday life. Does it use sequential, binary, or some other search algorithm?
