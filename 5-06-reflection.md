# 5.06 Quiz App Projects

1. Describe your solution for the second project that added a Search button. Provide a screenshot of the search button click code that uses a complex algorithm with loops and lists. Why was a loop necessary?

2. Write AP text-style pseudocode for a linear search that searches through a list to find an item x. It should display found if the x is equal to an item in the list.

3. Give brief descriptions of the enhancements you added to your app for the third project, a quiz topic of your own choosing. Provide screenshots of important blocks and describe how you used them to solve certain programming problems.

4. To practice for the Create project prompt, grab a screenshot of a program code segment from your project that implements an algorithm that includes two or more algorithms within it and includes mathematical and/or logical concepts. An ideal algorithm is a procedure that you created that includes calls to other procedures that you created, where at least one of those includes math or logic (ifs or loops).  Describe how each of the two algorithms within the bigger algorithm functions independently as well as in combination to form a new algorithm.
